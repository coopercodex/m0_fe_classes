# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  1. felt lost at first and had to escape the unproductive struggle but found help.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  1. its going good throughout this course of this week things have gotten into more of a flow.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  1. honestly i think im equipped to face the challenges ahead! I need to stick to my calender and ill be fine.
